# **HEXAeBPF: The Future of Interoperable eBPF Defined 5G Core (eDC)**
*Empowering the next generation of 5G core deployments with simplicity, interoperability, and automation.*

---

## **Introduction**
HEXAeBPF is a Kubernetes (K8s) Operator designed to redefine how open-source 5G core networks are deployed and managed. By integrating and automating the deployment of Control Plane (CP) from Vendor A and eBPF-based User Plane (UP) from Vendor B, HEXAeBPF enables seamless, end-to-end 5G lab setups with minimal effort.
Whether you're a telecom researcher, developer, or operator, HEXAeBPF simplifies deployment processes, fosters interoperability, and accelerates the evolution of 5G core networks.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Interoperable 5G Core Solution:** Integrates CP from one vendor with UP from another, offering unparalleled flexibility.
- **Zero Effort Deployment:** Automates deployment with no prior technical knowledge required.
- **One-Click Deployment (OCD):** A single command sets up the entire 5G core solution.
- **Interactive CLI:** User-friendly terminal interface for configuration and management.
- **E2E Connectivity:** Full integration with RAN simulators for end-to-end testing.
- **Open Source Accessibility:** Promotes collaboration and innovation in the telecom industry.

---

## **Advantages**
1. **Interoperability:** Modular design allows seamless integration between various open-source CP and eUP components.
2. **Efficiency and Speed:** eBPF-based UPF optimizes performance, while one-click deployment drastically reduces setup time.
3. **Future-Ready:** Aligns with the dynamic nature of 5G, ensuring adaptability to modern network demands.
4. **Open Source Collaboration:** A community-driven approach fosters continuous innovation in 5G core solutions.

---

## **Why HEXAeBPF is Built as a Kubernetes Operator?**
Kubernetes Operators are ideal for automated, scalable, and flexible management. HEXAeBPF leverages this technology to provide:
- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):** Simplified configuration of CP and eUP components.
- **Automated Lifecycle Management:** Handles scaling, updates, and self-healing tasks seamlessly.
- **Consistency and Reliability:** Ensures uniform deployment and management across diverse environments.
- **Reduced Complexity:** Abstracts complex networking and configuration challenges.

---

## **How HEXAeBPF Works**
1.	Choose your desired Control Plane.
2.	Select a compatible eBPF-based User Plane that works seamlessly with your chosen Control Plane.
3.	Pick the supported RAN Simulator for end-to-end testing.
4.	Tada! That’s all you need to do—your E2E deployment will be ready within minutes!

## **Deployment**
Simplified deployment is the cornerstone of HEXAeBPF. Use the following command for an interactive CLI experience:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coranlabs/HEXAeBPF.git ~/
cd ~/HEXAeBPF
make run_hexaebpf
```
